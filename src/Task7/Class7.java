    //Package or default access level is second highest restrictive access modifier after private and any variable,
    // method or class declared as package-private is only accessible on the package it belongs. The good thing about
    // default modifier is that top level class can also be package-private if there is no class level access modifier.

   // Protected method, variable or nested class not only accessible inside a class, inside the package but also
    // outside of package on a subclass. If you declare a variable protected means anyone can use it if they extend your class.
    // The top level class can not be make protected as well.
